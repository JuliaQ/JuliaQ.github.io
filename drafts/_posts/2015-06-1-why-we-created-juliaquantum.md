## Something about Julia language and quantum simulating/computing
* Fast development for coding scientific works.
* High performance for computational heavy simulations.
* Possibly can be used to easily program future quantum machines for easy programming and efficiently controlling hardwares in real time.
See for example, [Julia2C](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/julia-dev/iBsehcB62kM) discussions.

## Something about organizing
* Establish some fundamental functions to ease high level developments.
* Build a common basis to reduce barriers of integrating packages together.
* Forge a sustainable ecosystem for Julia program developments.
* Encourage crossing-disciplinary collaborations for
a better understanding of mathematics, quantum science and technology and computational tools.
