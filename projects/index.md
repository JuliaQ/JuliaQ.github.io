title:  Projects - Julia Libraries for Quantum Science and Technology
---

Below is an overview of the open-source projects that have been carried on under the JuliaQuantum organization.
As a fairly new organization for the fresh programming language--Julia,
we hope our projects can span into a good base for the broad spectrum of quantum science and technology.
If you have an idea to start a new project towards our goal,
please file an [issue](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/Roadmap/issues).
Contributions to existing projects are also highly appreciated.
Our current major focus is the [QuBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/QuBase.jl) project as a fundamental project for branching packages. As the QuBase.jl is closing to release the first version, we are looking for proposals and protypes of advanced projects for the next. Please check the [overall roadmaps](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/Roadmap) and issues on existing projects to find out where you can make a contribution. 
Please [watch](https://help.github.com/articles/watching-repositories/) or [star](https://github.com/blog/1204-notifications-stars) our projects to receive notifications of updates. Thank you for your interest! 

### [JuliaQuantum.github.io](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/JuliaQuantum.github.io)

This is the GitHub repository for the JuliaQuantum organization's main website,
[juliaquantum.github.io](http://juliaquantum.github.io).
Organizational announcements, Q&A and general discussions regarding the JuliaQuantum organization and overall projects
can also be posted on its [issue page](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/JuliaQuantum.github.io/issues). 
Please [watch](https://help.github.com/articles/watching-repositories/) or [star](https://github.com/blog/1204-notifications-stars) this repository to receive prompt notifications of the organizational activities.


### [Roadmap](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/Roadmap)

This repository hosts discussions and documentations of overall and individual projects' roadmaps
under JuliaQuantum.
Proposals of new projects under the organization can be posted on its [issue page](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/Roadmap/issues).

### [Resources](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/Resources)

This repo stores some public resources from JuliaQuantum including meetup slides, educational demos and so on. 


### [QuBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/QuBase.jl)

A foundational library for quantum mechanics in Julia.
It aims to provide a unifying type structure and set of basic functions for computational quantum mechanics.
This repo is currently a work in progress,
and is basically built upon the [QuDirac.jl](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/QuDirac.jl) project
started by [jrevels](https://github.com/jrevels).

### [QuDirac.jl](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/QuDirac.jl)

A library for performing quantum mechanics using Dirac notation in Julia.
Some of its functionalities have been merged into the [QuBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/QuBase.jl) project
as a joint effort for building a basic quantum representation library for high-level JuliaQuantum projects.
