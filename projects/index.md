title:  Projects - Julia Libraries for Quantum Science and Technology
---

Below is an overview of the open-source projects that have been carried on under the JuliaQuantum organization.
As a fairly new organization for the fresh programming language--Julia,
we hope our projects can span into a good base for the broad spectrum of quantum science and technology.
If you have an idea to start a new project towards our goal,
please file an [issue](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/Roadmap/issues).
Contributions to existing projects are also highly appreciated.

### JuliaQuantum.github.io

This is the GitHub repository for the JuliaQuantum organization's main website,
[juliaquantum.github.io](http://juliaquantum.github.io).
Organizational announcements and general discussions regarding the JuliaQuantum organization
can also be posted on its [issue page](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/JuliaQuantum.github.io/issues).


### Roadmap

This project as a text repository is for discussions and documentations of overall and cross-repo roadmaps
for JuliaQuantum projects.
Proposals of new projects under the organization can be posted on its [issue page](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/Roadmap/issues).

### QuBase.jl

A foundational library for quantum mechanics in Julia.
It aims to provide a unifying type structure and set of basic functions for computational quantum mechanics.
This repo is currently a work in progress,
and is basically built upon the [QuDirac.jl](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/QuDirac.jl) project
started by [jrevels](https://github.com/jrevels).

### QuDirac.jl

A library for performing quantum mechanics using Dirac notation in Julia.
Some of its functionalities have been merged into the [QuBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/QuBase.jl) project
as a joint effort for building a basic quantum representation library for high-level JuliaQuantum projects.
