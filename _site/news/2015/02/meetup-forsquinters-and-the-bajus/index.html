<p>During the <a href="http://physics.unm.edu/SQuInT/index.php">17th annual Southwest Quantum Information and Technology (SQuInT) workshop</a> from Feb 19 to 21, 2015, JuliaQuantum organization will host a <em>breakout session</em> for the SQuInTers and the Bay area Julia users <strong><em>on Feb 21 (Saturday) from 7:30pm to 10pm</em></strong> in the <strong><em>Room Berkeley, DoubleTree Hilton Hotel</em></strong>, 200 Marina Blvd., Berkeley, California, where the workshop is hosted. The location of the Berkeley room in the hotel can be found <a href="http://doubletree3.hilton.com/resources/media/dt/JBKCADT/en_US/pdf/en_JBKCADT_Meeting_Factsheet_June12.pdf">here</a>. It is on the second floor of the building. Beyond this <em>breakout session</em>, <a href="https://github.com/jrevels">Jarrett Revels</a>, one of the creators of JuliaQuantum, will present a <em>poster</em> (see #86 of the <a href="http://physics.unm.edu/SQuInT/abstracts.php">abstract page</a>) on <strong><em>Feb 19</em></strong> in the workshop, and along with <a href="https://github.com/i2000s">Xiaodong Qi</a>&ndash;another creator of this organization&ndash;will lead a <em>lunch gethering time</em> for SQuInTers who are interested in Julia and our projects on <strong><em>Feb 20</em></strong> in the lunch place of the workshop (our JuliaQuantum logo will show up on the lunch table).</p>

<p>In the <em>breakout session</em> or the <em>meetup</em> on Feb 21 night, there will be three talks on the topic of <em>Scientific Applications of Julia</em> presented by <strong><em><a href="https://www.philipithomas.com/julia-jump/">Philip Thomas</a></em></strong> from <a href="https://www.staffjoy.com/">StaffJoy</a>, <strong><em><a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~dzeng0/">David Zeng</a></em></strong> and <strong><em><a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~kvmohan/">Karanveer Mohan</a></em></strong> from <a href="http://stanford.edu/~boyd/">Stanford University</a>, and <strong><em><a href="http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~kshyatt/">Katharine Hyatt</a></em></strong> from University of California &ndash; Santa Barbara on condensed matter theory. These talks are featured with optimization, quantum statistics and parallel computing in Julia, all of which heavily rely on numerics and could be applied to numerical simulations of quantum systems, optimal quantum control &amp; metrology, quantum machine learning simulations and so on. In the mean time, these are also topics Julia is good at, and have been applied in a wide range of areas. In fact, JuliaQuantum is looking for the possibilities of interfacing with those well-developed packages and programs for our future projects of quantum libraries in Julia. In the talks, our invited speakers will demonstrate how easily Julia packages can be used to solve problems in those fields. These talks could trigger a long-term collaborations crossing disciplines and bring in new users and developers for our projects as well.</p>

<p>Below is the detailed agenda for the Feb 21 breakout/meetup session. Limited refreshments and water will be served 15min before it starts.</p>

<h2>Agenda for Feb 21</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>7:30 Meetup starts with a brief introduction to the event, our sponsor &amp; host organization&ndash;JuliaQuantum.</p></li>
<li><p>7:35-8:10 Talk #1: <em>Predictive Analysis in Julia - An overview of the JuMP package for optimization</em></p>

<p>  Speaker: Philip Thomas from StaffJoy</p>

<p>  Abstract: This talk provides a brief overview of the JuMP package for optimization in Julia.
JuMP provides an extensible tool for expressing and solving linear programming, integer programming, and convex programing problems. This talk will focus on expressing problems in the JuMP metalanguage, including a knapsack problem and constraint programming problem. A Lagrangian mechinics problem may be discussed as an example.</p></li>
<li><p>8:15-8:50 Talk #2: <em>Convex.jl: Optimization for Everyone</em></p>

<p>  Speakers: David Deng and Karanveer Mohan, possibly also with Jenny Hong
and Madeleine Udell from Stanford.</p>

<p>  Abstract: This talk will start with a brief overview of how the
Convex.jl package works and the types of problems it can solve, and
really showcase how convenient it is to use. It will be clear that
Convex.jl is easily usable by just about anyone for their basic
optimization needs. One or two more involved applications of using
Convex.jl to solve real world problems will be demonstrated from a good
pool of examples. Hopefully there will be an example on quantum tomography.</p></li>
<li><p>8:50-9:25 Talk #3: <em>Quantum Statistical Simulations with Julia</em></p>

<p>  Speaker: Katharine Hyatt from UCSB</p>

<p>  Abstract: Using computers to probe quantum systems is becoming more
and more common in condensed matter physics research. Many of the
commonly used languages and techniques in this space are either
difficult to learn or not performant. Julia has allowed us to quickly
develop and test codes for a variety of commonly used algorithms,
including exact diagonalization and quantum Monte Carlo. Its parallel
features, including some MPI and GPGPU integration, make it particularly
attractive for many quantum simulation problems. I&rsquo;ll discuss what
features of Julia have been most useful for us when working on these
simulations and the developments we&rsquo;re most excited about.</p></li>
<li><p>9:25-10:00pm Julia users interaction time as well as the Julia
developer business session time (at different zones of the room).</p></li>
</ul>
