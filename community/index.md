title:  Community - Julia Libraries for Quantum Science and Technology
---

The sustainable development of JuliaQuantum organization and the associated projects
highly depend on the participation and embrace of the community in large.
JuliaQuantum as an open-source organization is working on building fundamental Julia libraries
upon requests and proposals through the issue tracking and discussion forums provided by [GitHub](http://github.com).
Feel free to send pull request, ask questions and participate discussions on particular repositories.
Technical support regarding the Julia programming language itself
should direct to the [julia-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/julia-users) mailing list.

JuliaQuantum members also work on bringing to our developers
with volunteers and experts for academic and public supports.
If you know individuals or groups of people, or yourself, are willing to serve
any non-trivial role for JuliaQuantum, please [email us](mailto:{{ site.manageremail }}).
Currently, we have the following supporting groups.

### Academic consulting committee
This committee responds to JuliaQuantum members for scientific insights and advice
to improve the quality and value of the Julia libraries under our organization.
Please respect that committee members are all from academic institutes
and mostly could only dedicate limited time to our recognized members.

Current member on board:
[Dr. Kevin Cahill](http://physics.unm.edu/pandaweb/people/person.php?personID=5) from University of New Mexico,
who is an expert on quantum field theory, quantum optics and physical mathematics.
His recent book on [Physical Mathematics](http://www.cambridge.org/us/knowledge/discountpromotion/?site_locale=en_US&code=L2PMKC)
has been recognized as a [Best Book of 2014 on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Physical-Mathematics-Kevin-Cahill/dp/1107005213/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1363234719&sr=1-1&keywords=Physical+Mathematics).
Most of his recent course videos are also free to watch online through [his website](http://theory.phys.unm.edu/).

Looking for more nominations and participants to serve in the committee.


### Supporting Groups
* [CQuIC on GitHub](http://cquic-github.github.io/):
an open-source project team who are working on open-source packages including the well-known [qcircuit](https://github.com/CQuIC-GitHub/qcircuit)
LaTeX package for drawing quantum circuits in LaTeX with ease.
Some of the initial JuliaQuantum members come from them.
They also help bring JuliaQuantum to the [17th Annual SQuINT workshop](http://physics.unm.edu/SQuInT/).

* [ICIQ community](http://iciq.github.io/): an open community based on the [Information, Computation, Intelligence and Quantum Google+ community](Information, Computation, Intelligence and Quantum),
who provides free online talks, news reports, study materials and community open source projects
to both classical and quantum information communities for accelerating technical advances.
They help integrate JuliaQuantum projects into a broader group.

[Email us](mailto:{{ site.manageremail }}) if you are willing to support the JuliaQuantum organization!

### JuliaQuantum Steering Team
As the title illustrated, they are working on ensure JuliaQuantum moving on a right track.

Current members (alphabetical order): [acroy](https://github.com/acroy),
[jiahao](https://github.com/jiahao), [jrevels](https://github.com/jrevels) and [Jutho](https://github.com/Jutho).

Other members of JuliaQuantum may be found on [our GitHub page](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum),
if they set to be visible to public.
