  <p>It has been a great pleasure to organize this meetup session at Berkeley on 2015-02-21 along with <em>Jarrett Revels</em>.
Video records and slides of our meetup are online now!</p>

<p>On record, two major topics have been targeted:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Optimization, statistics and parallel computing programming techniques
which are required for quantum tomography, optimal quantum control and quantum metrology among others
to handle the classical user interface even when quantum computers are implemented in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Simulating quantum systems on a classical computer environment before quantum computers become mature.
This involves quantum Monte Carlo simulations, stochastic process simulations, simulating quantum error correction codes
and other numerical simulation scenarios which strongly appreciate a fast and easy-to-use programming interface.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Speakers in this talk series demonstrated in various aspects showing that
Julia as a fresh programming language is competent to help ease tasks fell into the two topics listed above.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Opening remarks</em></strong> by <em>Xiaodong Qi</em>:</p>

<li><p><strong><em>Video of the interaction session</em></strong>: Whoooops, this part was not recorded&hellip;
However, through the interaction between our audience and Julia developers at the meetup,
feedbacks from the audience of quantum community have been effectively reached to the Julia developers.
Meanwhile, Julia developers have also demonstrated a lot of exciting features of Julia to a new group of people who may not know Julia before.
This event along with the poster presentation and a brief lunch meeting in the student-friendly quantum information workshop is a joint effort
to bring interactions among people from the computer science, mathematics, quantum science, engineering fields
who are interested in high-performance and high-level programming languages.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>After this event, I may not have a chance to participate the future development of JuliaQuantum community any more.
But I believe, with the spirit of dedication and openness, this open-source community will have a bright and promising future
through the continuing endeavors from <a href="https://github.com/jrevels">Jarrett</a>, <a href="https://github.com/acroy">Alex</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/jiahao">Jiahao</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Jutho">Jutho</a> and among others.
It has been a great joy to work with them. I am grateful for their supports as a team.
Gratitudes also go to all of our speakers and audience for their dedication and patience.
All of the expenses to attend this meetup are out of their own pockets, and many of our audience even did not have time to have dinner just to attend our meetup until very late that night.
I would also like to sincerely acknowledge some other people who have offered a hand to help make this event happen and ease related affairs for the JuliaQuantum organization.
They are, but not limited to,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tony Kelman and Kyle Barbary from UC Berkeley,</p></li>
<li><p>Stefan Karpinski and Jiahao Chen from MIT,</p></li>
<li><p>Mykel Kochenderfer and Jack Poulson from Sanford University,</p></li>
<li><p>Hunter Owens, Matthias Bussonnier, Shashi Gowda, Jay Weisskopf, pao, Jameson Nash, Isaiah, John White, Tim Holy, one-more-minute, Matt Bauman, Chris Peel, peter1000 as Julia developers on GitHub,</p></li>
<li><p>Peter Golpeo from the DoubleTree hotel,</p></li>
<li><p>Berilyn Thomas and Ivan from UNM,</p></li>
<li><p>and many others got connected.</p></li>
</ul>
