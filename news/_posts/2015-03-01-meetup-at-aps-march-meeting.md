The annual March Meeting of the American Physical Society is on the way from March 2-6 in San Antonio, and our friends Katharine Hyatt and many others will be there.
In case any Julia users would be interested in getting together there to chat for a bit, [here is the Doodle poll](http://doodle.com/sesc55rsd8hd59ag).
A post on Julia-users group is also [alive](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/julia-users/2rqxOq_wkCE) :-)  

Update on March 3: Current plan is to meet outside room 007A on Thursday (March 5) at 5:30pm and then walk to dinner somewhere together. Feel free to join. 

Have a nice Julia-flavored conference!
