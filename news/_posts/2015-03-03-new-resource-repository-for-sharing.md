Now we have a new repository -- [***Resources***](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/Resources)!

If you have been using Julia to solve your quantum-related homework problems or for your research/teaching *et al*, feel free to pump some examples, demos or notes in the ***Resources*** repository through GitHub.
Examples of using JuliaQuantum packages are encouraged--but not limited--to be uploaded in the repo.
Links to talks, small tools or any other genetic materials on our topics could also be useful to dump there. 
Right at the moment of writing, there have been contributed talks, slides and interactive notes from the [Julia users meetup at Berkeley hosted by JuiaQuantum on Feb 21, 2015](//juliaquantum.github.io/news/2015/03/berkeley-meetup-videos-online).

Certainly, if you are looking for resources mentioned above, our new repo may be a good place to start with.

Happy sharing!
