The Information, Computation, Intelligence and Quantum ([ICIQ](http://iciq.github.io/)) community has been rapidly developing rooted on its [Google+ community](https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107578658308929247968/communities/112872767737673370045) to bring news, discussions, talks, open-source projects and study materials of quantum information science to the classical and quantum information communities. 
JuliaQuantum is now integrating some of its projects into the big gathering of ICIQ community. 

JuliaQuantum has setup a [Google+ public page](google.com/+JuliaquantumGithubIoPage) and will use it to announce progress of JuliaQuantum projects over the ICIQ network. 
This will help us efficiently target our users groups for our corresponding projects. 
As a joint effort, ICIQ also started a trial [Tutorials and Reviews section](http://iciq.github.io/observe.html) on its website to help collect useful self-study materials for quantum information learners in all levels. 
All links and linked materials are maintained by volunteers in the open-source community. 
This will help our package developers learn necessary background knowledge much efficiently. 

Have any study materials useful to share? Fork the ICIQ's [GitHub source code repository](https://github.com/ICIQ/iciq.github.io) and start contributing!
