The [QuBase.jl](http://github.com/JuliaQuantum/QuBase.jl) repository was initialized on Dec 14, 2014.

It is committed to be  
>a Julia package that provides a unifying type structure and set of basic functions for computational quantum mechanics.

Thoughts and code contributions are [welcome](http://github.com/JuliaQuantum/QuBase.jl)!
