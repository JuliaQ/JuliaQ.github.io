We are happy to inform that JuliaQuantum members will be presenting talks at Julia Users Meetup at [USTC](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/), Hefei, China, on
the 25th of December starting 11 AM GMT. 
The plan is to disseminate Julia to the big harbor of Quantum Information researches in China as well introduce the Chinese Julia community to the ongoing work at JuliaQuantum. 
Xiaodong Qi will also have an academic visit and introduce JuliaQuantum to the Key Lab of Quantum Information in USTC while the recent work on the simultaneous quantum teleportation of two inherent properties of a photon by researchers from the lab was just recognized as the [Physics World 2015 Breakthrough of the Year](http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2015/dec/11/double-quantum-teleportation-milestone-is-physics-world-2015-breakthrough-of-the-year). 
The meetup will be hosted by Xiuzhe (Roger) Luo from USTC, and will accept remote live connections through internet. 
The following are the details of the two talks:


* Talk #1 : *New opportunities with JuliaQuantum -- personal perspective on Quantum Information*

    Speaker: Xiaodong Qi, cofounder of JuliaQuantum.

    Talk language: Chinese (English available in slides)

    Abstract : This talk will be sharing the experiences of establishing JuliaQuantum, the overall state of development of the organization and some thoughts on the future directions.
The speaker will bias on the efforts of building the software ecosystem for quantum information applications, and raise attentions to the
great opportunities for students and scholars with backgrounds from computer science, physics and all the other disciplines and generous sponsors
with the future JuliaQuantum development. The experiences shared in the talk could also be helpful for other open-source projects and organizations.

* Talk #2 : *QuDynamics: Julia package for solving dynamic equations in Quantum Mechanics*

    Speaker: Amit Jamadagni, key contributor @ JuliaQuantum.

    Talk language: English

    Abstract : This talk will outline the development of [QuDynamics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/QuDynamics.jl) and related projects under construction or released by JuliaQuantum,
    along with a few examples. The speaker will also introduce how to contribute to the projects. The talk also aims to briefly introduce
    the Julia programming language and the popular version control system Git. Materials from a similar meetup in Fudan University, Shanghai, China, a few weeks ago can be found at the following GitHub repo
    ([SageMathCloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com/) was used to present the use of Julia, JuliaQuantum packages).

There are also *limited* remote meeting connections available. Please do register by filling this [form](https://www.wenjuan.com/s/Y3Qf6f/), if a remote access is requested.
Hoping to see you on 25th! Slides, video records and other material will be uploaded onto the [Resources](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/Resources/) repo after the talk.
