We are happy to inform that JuliaQuantum developers will be presenting talks at Julia Users Meetup at USTC on
the 25th of December starting 11 AM GMT. The plan is to attract new developers as well introduce them to the
ongoing work at JuliaQuantum. The following are the details of the plan :


* Talk #1 : *New opportunities with JuliaQuantum with emphasis on Quantum Information*

    Speaker: Xiaodong Qi, cofounder of JuliaQuantum.

    Talk language: Chinese (English available in slides)

    Abstract : This talk will be sharing the experiences of establishing JuliaQuantum and the overall state of development of the organization.
The speaker will bias on the efforts of building the software ecosystem for quantum information applications, and raise attentions to the
great opportunities for students and scholars with backgrounds from computer science, physics and all the other disciplines and generous sponsors
with the future JuliaQuantum development. The experiences shared here could also be helpful for other open-source projects and organizations.

* Talk #2 : *QuDynamics: Julia package for solving dynamic equations in Quantum Mechanics*

    Speaker: Amit Jamadagni, developer @ JuliaQuantum.

    Talk language: English

    Abstract : This talk will outline the development of [QuDynamics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/QuDynamics.jl) and related projects under construction or released by JuliaQuantum.
    along with few examples. The speaker will also introduce how to contribute to the projects. The talk also aims to briefly introduce
    the Julia programming language and the popular version control system Git. Materials from previous meetup can be found at the following GitHub repo
    ([SageMathCloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com/) was used to present the use of Julia, JuliaQuantum packages).
