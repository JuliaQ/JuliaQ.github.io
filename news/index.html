  <p>The JuliaQuantum News page presents updates of the <a href="/">JuliaQuantum organization</a> and <a href="/projects">projects</a>.
    Posts are written in a blogging style by JuliaQuantum developers,
    and often cover issues of numerical, technical, distributed and parallel computing for quantum sciences and technologies,
    as well as quantum simulation program design in Julia, and how these issues touch upon the design and implementation of the JuliaQuantum libraries.</p>
